Notes concerning joining of cvs and svn histories in git:

In order to define a fast import stream git can append to the cvs conversion,
the svn export should use the marks for various objects and commits used by the
cvs history.  This list can be generated via git fast-export --all of the cvs
conversion while specifying a file in which to record the map:

cd brlcad_cvs_git
git fast-export --all --export-marks=../marks_file > ../export.fi
cd ..
mkdir repo_dir && cd repo_dir
git init
cat ../export.fi | git fast-import

A quick experiment using a manually adjusted incremenal output from
https://github.com/satori/git-svn-fast-import indicates the from property will
have to be defined in the new commits respecting the above marks, and new mark
ids should increment starting from the maximum mark in the marks_file

cat ../29887.fi | git fast-import --import-marks=../marks_file

Consequently, the svn fast-export code will have to be aware of the marks_file
contents when it generates its output.
