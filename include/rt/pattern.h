/**
 * Make a bundle of rays around a main ray using a generator
 *
 * If data is NULL, return -1
 *
 * If the data in the rt_pattern_data struct does not meet the requirements
 * of the specified pattern, return -2
 *
 * If data->rays is NULL, return the number of rays that would have
 * been generated.
 *
 * If data->rays is not NULL and ray_cnt does not match the number of rays
 * that will be generated, return -3.
 *
 * If data->rays is not NULL and ray_cnt matches the number of rays
 * that will be generated, assign rays to the rays output.
 *
 *
 * Pattern data for each pattern type:
 *
 *   * all lengths are in mm;
 *   * center_ray.r_dir must have unit length, if
 *   * parameter data arrays are necessary they are the responsibility of
 *     the calling function
 *
 *   RT_RECT_GRID:
 *      Make a bundle of orthogonal rays around a center ray as a uniform
 *      rectangular grid.  Grid extents are from -a_vec to a_vec and -b_vec
 *      to b_vec.
 *      Params:
 *         center_ray
 *         a_vec       Direction for up
 *         b_vec       Direction for right
 *         p1          offset between rays in the a direction
 *         p2          offset between rays in the b direction
 *   RT_FRUSTUM:
 *      Make a bundle of rays around a main ray in the shape of a frustum
 *      as a uniform rectangular grid.
 *      Params:
 *         center_ray
 *         a_vec       Direction for up
 *         b_vec       Direction for right
 *         p_n = 4     Number of parameters
 *         n_p[0]      angle of divergence in the direction of a_vec
 *         n_p[1]      angle of divergence in the direction of b_vec
 *         n_p[2]      a_num
 *         n_p[3]      b_num
 *
 *   RT_CIRCULAR_GRID:
 *      Make a bundle of rays around a main ray using a uniform rectangular
 *      grid pattern with a circular extent.
 *      Params:
 *         center_ray
 *         a_vec       Direction for up
 *         p1          grid size
 *         p2          Radius
 *
 *   RT_CONIC:
 *      Make a bundle of rays around a main ray in the shape of a cone,
 *      using a uniform rectangular grid.
 *      Params:
 *         center_ray
 *         a_vec       Direction for up
 *         p1          angle of divergence of the cone
 *         p2          number of rays that line on each radial ring of the cone
 *
 *   RT_ELLIPTICAL_GRID:
 *      Make a bundle of rays around a main ray using a uniform rectangular
 *      grid pattern with an elliptical extent.
 *      Params:
 *         center_ray
 *         a_vec       Direction for up
 *         b_vec       Direction for right
 *         p1          grid size
 *
 *
 * return negative on error (data will be unmodified in error condition)
 *        ray count on success (>=0)
 *
 *
 * If ray count greater than zero, data->rays array will hold rays generated by pattern
 *
 *
 * The following is an example:
@code
int ray_cnt = 0;
struct rt_pattern_data data = RT_PATTERN_DATA_INIT;
VSET(data.a_vec, 0, 0, 1);
data.p1 = 0.1
data.p2 = 10
ray_cnt = rt_pattern(&data, RT_CIRCULAR_GRID);
