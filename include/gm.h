/** @addtogroup libgm
 *
 * BRL-CAD geometry library. This library is intended for generic
 * geometry algorithms, such as point-in-polygon, does a line
 * intersect a sphere, ear clipping triangulation of a polygon, etc.
 *
 * Algorithms in this library should not require solid raytracing
 * of the BRL-CAD CSG boolean hierarchy - routines using those high
 * level constructs should be in libanalyze, which uses librt to
 * do the necessary raytracing.  libgm is lower level, and should
 * depend only on the numerics library (libbn) and the libbu utility
 * (libbu)
 *
 * Strictly numerical algorithms, which do not involve 3D geometry
 * concepts, belong in libbn.  An example of something that would belong
 * in libbn would be sparse matrix solving.
 *
 * The functionality provided by this library is specified in the gm.h
 * header or appropriate included files from the ./gm subdirectory.
