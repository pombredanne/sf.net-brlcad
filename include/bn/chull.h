 * @brief
 * Find 3D coplanar point convex hull for unordered co-planar point sets
 *
 * This function assumes an input an array of 3D points which are coplanar
 * in some arbitrary plane.  This function:
 *
 * 1. Finds the plane that fits the points and picks an origin, x-axis and y-axis
 *    which allow 2D coordinates for all points to be calculated.
 * 2. Calls 2D routines on the array found by step 1 to get a 2D convex hull
 * 3. Translates the resultant 2D hull points back into 3D points so the hull array
 *    contains the bounding hull expressed in the 3D coordinate space of the
 *    original points.
